# Rickdiculously Easy

I found the Rickdiculously Easy CTF on [Vulnhub](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/rickdiculouslyeasy-1,207/). It was a fun challenge based on
the TV show Rick and Morty. To begin any virtual machine (VM) based CTF, the first step is to change the target and attacking machine to the
network adapter. This ensures that I can attack the vulnerable system without disturbing anyone else and ensures that I am not opening myself
up to vulnerabilities.

## Information Gathering

After powering up the vulnerable VM, I was met with the following screen:

<div className="flex justify-center mt-4">
  <Image src="/rick/image4.png" alt="image4" width={500} height={500} />
</div>

The 'Admin Console' gives us the target IP straight away, but for practice sake I
started with an nmap scan of the IP address range.

```console
kali@kali:~$ nmap 192.168.56.1/24
Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2023-10-24 00:54 EDT
Nmap scan report for 192.168.56.103
Host is up (0.000018s latency).
All 1000 scanned ports on 192.168.56.103 are closed

Nmap scan report for 192.168.56.104
Host is up (0.0032s latency).
Not shown: 996 closed ports
PORT     STATE SERVICE
21/tcp   open  ftp
22/tcp   open  ssh
80/tcp   open  http
9090/tcp open  zeus-admin

Nmap done: 256 IP addresses (2 hosts up) scanned in 37.70 seconds
```

No surprise, the only other IP on the network is the same one shown on the vulnerable machine.

## Scanning

I did an nmap scan on the target IP:

```bash
kali@kali:~$ sudo nmap -Pn -sS -p- 192.168.56.104
```

This time I added some flags to ensure I did not miss anything.

- The -Pn flag tells nmap to skip the ping test and scan every target host provided.
- The -sS flag scans TCP ports and is stealthier than a connect scan.
- The -p- flag will scan every possible port within a range, or simply all ports if no range is given.

This scan returned a slightly different result:

```console
Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2023-10-24 01:03 EDT
Nmap scan report for 192.168.56.104

22222/tcp open  easyengine

MAC Address: 08:00:27:8C:C5:94 (Oracle VirtualBox virtual NIC)

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 19.84 seconds
```

## Gaining Access

After some basic port scanning, I attempted to gain access to the server. Port 80 being opened caught my eye so I tried to access the
IP via a browser. I found 'Morty's cool website':

<div className="flex justify-center mt-4">
  <Image src="/rick/image17.png" alt="image17" width={500} height={500} />
</div>

Nothing was really revealed on the webpage, so I tried a dictionary attack using Dirb. Dirb is a tool that checks for directories on a
web server from a common wordlist.

```bash
kali@kali:~$ dirb http://192.168.56.104
```

The dirb attacked found a few useful directories:

```console

I tried to access the directories via the browser, first was passwords:

<div className="flex justify-center mt-4">
  <Image src="/rick/image14.png" alt="image14" width={500} height={500} />
</div>

This revealed the first flag and a passwords.html file:

</div>
