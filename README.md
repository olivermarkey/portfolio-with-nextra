# My Portfolio website

This is a NextJS app built to show what I can do and the projects I have worked on. I built it using
a combination of inspiration from other portfolio websites and help from the Nextra documentation
template.

## Nextra

This is a template for creating documentation with [Nextra](https://nextra.site).

## Portfolio design inspiration

I utilised this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb1f5bvF6f4) to help in building this site. I recommend it if you are
looking to create something similar.
